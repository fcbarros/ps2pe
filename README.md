# ps2pe
Old PS2 emulator with debugging and ability to run some homebrew content.

# Important
This project is a PoC done in 2002, it runs some homebrew ELF demos, can disassembly code, but it is old code, buggy and I was experimenting.  
I later join the PCSX2 team and continue the work there. (https://pcsx2.net/)  
  
It only run on windows, x86.  
  
2 projects:
* PS2PEDLL: The emulator itself  
* PS2PE: A Windows MFC Interface for the emulator.
